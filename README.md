## Oren Hadry

Senior software engineer with a strong focus on **systems design, execution discipline, and risk-aware engineering**.

I work primarily on backend and infrastructure-heavy systems, with experience building production-grade services as well as research‑oriented proof‑of‑concepts. My interests sit at the intersection of **distributed systems, data-driven decision making, and correctness under real‑world constraints**.

---

## What I focus on

- Designing systems that behave predictably under uncertainty
- Clear separation between decision logic, execution, and state management
- Reducing risk and variance through engineering choices, not heuristics
- Code that is readable, inspectable, and defensible in technical reviews

## Selected Projects

### MomentumTrader
**Python market‑making trading system (personal project)**  
A conservative, risk‑aware trading system operating primarily as a market maker. The strategy avoids price chasing, reduces fees and execution costs, limits directional exposure, and prioritizes stability over aggressiveness. Ran continuously for ~6 months on real market data with stable and promising results.

## About this profile

This GitHub account is used to publish **self‑contained technical projects** that reflect how I think about system design and engineering trade‑offs. Repositories are intended to be read and discussed, not just executed.
